Welcome to our final project in 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization (Spring 2023).We are a group of 3 students, each with different 
background and expertise. We are excited to collaborate on this project aimed to investigate traffic incidents in San Francisco using real-world,
publicly available data. Our data sources and preparation is referenced and explained in our Notebook deliverable.
<br><br>
Our motivation to choosing this particular project originates from multiple causes with the root in the class-wide Project Assignment A video 
runthrough and Peergrade review of classmates' projects. We found this project idea exciting because of its weight on both geodata and datetime 
analysis. We have chosen the abovementioned traffic Incident dataset due to its size, thorough content, and wide range of cities available for 
closer inspection. The city selection of San Francisco is, however, arbitrary and we'd like our analyses to be applicable to whichever selected city.
<br><br>
Our desired end goal with this project is to produce an analysis workflow in which any city's traffic incidents can be investigated, especially in
combination with other data sets, such as crime data.

<h3>The Structure of the Site</h3>

The site is structered as follows:
<br><br>
- Home redirects to the front page (current page), containing an introduction to the project and site structure.
<br><br>
- Analysis redirects to the exploratory analysis of the project, aimed to investigate traffic incidents in San Francisco by looking at the logged geodata and incident severity levels.
<br><br>
- The Maps page contains interactive maps of the traffic incidents in San Francisco.
<br><br>
- The Machine Learning is presented and explained in its own page, aimed to examine incident correlation using publicly available San Francisco crime data.
<br><br>
- About contains information about the project, team, and contains a redirection to the Notebook where all of the underlying analysis happens.
<br><br>
In the visualization, users can right click on the plots and select "Open picture in a new tab", which opens the plot a new tab of the browser, 
allowing for zooming, either with a right click for an enlarged zoom or CTRL+mousewheel measured zooming.
