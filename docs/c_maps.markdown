In our in-depth exploration of San Francisco's traffic landscape, we delve into the analysis of geospatial data representing start coordinates of traffic incidents. By visualizing this data in the form of a heatmap, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and densities of incidents throughout the city. Join us as we embark on this journey to unravel the intricacies of San Francisco's traffic incident landscape.

Upon generating the heatmap, a captivating picture of San Francisco's traffic incidents begins to emerge. Scattered across the city, these incidents paint a vivid picture of the challenges faced by commuters and transportation authorities alike. However, it is the areas of highest incident densities that truly capture our attention and warrant a closer analysis.

As we examine the heatmap, we are drawn to specific regions where traffic incidents appear to be concentrated. Prominently featured are the areas surrounding the iconic Oakland Bay Bridge, the bustling Dwight D. Eisenhower Highway, and the vital Bayshore Freeway - both integral sections of Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 101. Additionally, our analysis reveals a notable hotspot at the highway roundabout connecting Route 101 and Interstate 280.

As expected in the following choropleth map, we recognize the pattern that most incidents take place in the districts containing the abovementioned passage: Route 101, Interstate 80, and Interstate 280. The district containing the top most incidents is Southern (spanning the SoMa major neighborhood), followed by Mission District and Bayview where the densities follow Route 101 along the coastline.

Upon examining the figure, it becomes apparent that the most dense polyline stretches from the start of the Oakland Bay Bridge to the southern end of the Southern district. This observation underscores the concentration of incidents along this particular route, signifying the need for targeted attention and potential interventions.

Furthermore, the figure suggests varying incident densities in other districts based on their proximity to Route 101. Districts closer to Route 101 exhibit higher densities, indicating a potential correlation between traffic incidents and the proximity to this major road.
