Our group came together for the course Social data analysis and visualization (02806) offered by the Technical University of Denmark in spring 2023. Each of us brought our unique skills and experiences to the project, and we were excited to collaborate on a real-world data analysis project.

Our project was based on the US Accidents (2016 - 2021) dataset, a comprehensive collection of traffic accident data from across the United States. We knew that this dataset presented a unique opportunity to gain insights into the patterns and trends of traffic accidents, and we were eager to explore it further.

But we also wanted to add another dimension to our analysis. So we decided to supplement the accident data with information from the San Francisco Police Department's incident reports. We used two datasets: Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present and Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018. By combining these two sources of data, we hoped to gain a more complete picture of the factors contributing to traffic accidents in San Francisco.

We explored questions like: What are the most common causes of traffic accidents in San Francisco? Are certain types of accidents more likely to occur in certain locations or at certain times of day? And how have accident rates changed over time?

Through our analysis, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex factors that contribute to traffic accidents, and we hope that our work will help inform policy and decision-making in the future.
