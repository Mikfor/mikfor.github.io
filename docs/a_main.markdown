Welcome to our final project in the course Social Data Analysis and Visualization (02806) offered by the Technical University of Denmark in spring 2023. We are a group of 3 students with different backgrounds and experiences, and we are excited to collaborate on a real-world data analysis project.

This project aims to explore and analyze traffic incidents in San Francisco using publicly available data. San Francisco is known for its challenging driving conditions, with steep hills, narrow streets, changing traffic rules, and complex parking regulations that can make navigating the city difficult for even the most experienced drivers. By analyzing this data, we hope to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to traffic incidents in San Francisco and ultimately inform strategies for reducing accidents and improving road safety in the city.

We were inspired to choose this project after participating in the class-wide Project Assignment A and reviewing our classmates' projects on Peergrade. Our team found the idea of analyzing traffic incidents particularly intriguing, as it involves a combination of geodata and datetime analysis. We selected the US Accidents dataset due to its comprehensive nature, large size, and coverage of a wide range of cities. While we chose to focus on analyzing data from San Francisco, our ultimate goal is to develop insights that can be applied to other cities as well.

Our desired end goal with this project is to produce an analysis workflow in which any city's traffic incidents can be investigated, especially in combination with available crime data. We hope that our work will help inform policy and decision-making in the future.
